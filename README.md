Introduction
Every second counts in a medical emergency. In heavy traffic, ambulances struggle to reach hospitals on
time, costing precious lives. Our integrated system combines AI-powered traffic management with Digital
Twin technology inside the ambulance to ensure seamless emergency response.
Problem Statement
- Traffic congestion causes significant delays in emergency response times.
- Lack of real-time traffic management leads to inefficiencies in clearing paths for ambulances.
- Manual intervention by traffic police is often slow and ineffective.
- Medical professionals in hospitals lack real-time patient data before arrival.
- Critical treatments are delayed due to lack of immediate health insights.
- Doctors often have to make **instant decisions** with **limited patient data**, increasing the risk of errors.
Proposed Solution: AI-Powered Emergency System
Our AI-driven system integrates two key technologies:
1. **ResQRoute:** AI-based traffic management that detects ambulances and clears traffic automatically.
2. **Digital Twin for Health:** Inside the ambulance, AI builds a real-time patient clone using medical data to
predict their health status and guide doctors before arrival.
3. **Doctor Preparation System:** AI provides hospitals with real-time patient insights, ensuring the medical
team is prepared for immediate treatment upon arrival.
How It Works
1. **Ambulance Detection:** AI cameras recognize ambulance symbols and prioritize traffic light changes.
2. **Real-Time Traffic Adjustment:** AI controls traffic signals dynamically to create an open path.
3. **Patient Cloning Inside Ambulance:** Medical devices inside the ambulance monitor vital signs and feed
data to an AI model to simulate future health conditions.
4. **Doctor & Hospital Preparation:**
- AI provides a real-time **patient health clone** to doctors.
- Doctors analyze vital trends and predict possible complications before arrival.
- AI **suggests probable treatments** based on patient history and symptoms.
- Hospital staff prepares the necessary **operation theaters, ICUs, or emergency rooms** based on AI risk
assessment.
5. **Optimized Emergency Care:** Predictive analytics help doctors **make faster, more accurate decisions**
for treatment.
